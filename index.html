        <h1>The Final Hope Of Pakistan</h1>

        <p class="txt"> Imran Khan is a prominent Pakistani leader, former cricketer, 
            and philanthropist who served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan
             from 2018 to 2022. Before entering politics, he was an internationally celebrated 
             cricketer and led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. After retiring from cricket, 
             he dedicated himself to public service by building the Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital, Pakistan's 
             first cancer hospital of its kind, named after his mother. In 1996, he founded the political party
              Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) with a vision of justice, anti-corruption, and public welfare.
               Known for his strong stance on national sovereignty and social justice, Imran Khan remains a 
               significant figure in Pakistan's political and cultural history.
